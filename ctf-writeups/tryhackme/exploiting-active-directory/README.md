# Exploiting Active Directory

This phase exploits misconfigurations to perform a combination of lateral movement and privilege escalation until we reach a suitable position to execute our goals, as shown in the diagram below.

In this network, we will cover several methods that can be used to exploit AD misconfigurations. This is by no means a complete list, as available methods are usually highly situational and dependent on the AD structure and environment. However, we will cover the following techniques for exploiting AD:

* AD Delegation
* Forcing Authentication Relays
* Group Policy Objects
* Targeting AD Users
* Domain Trusts
* Silver and Golden Tickets
