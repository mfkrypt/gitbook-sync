# ret2win with parameters

In the last topic, we demonstrated a ret2win attack where the goal was to return to a function that we wanted. Now, we will be build up on that technique but will require to supply some function parameters to the function of choice. Also in this section, we will explore on how to perform the exploitation in the two different architectures which is x86 (32-bit) and x84\_64 (64-bit)
